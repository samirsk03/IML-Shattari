                <p>
                  Shattari order (Tariqah) is a great spiritual tradition of
                  Sufism and remains one of the most sacred, renowned,
                  respected, purely illuminated and pious lineage.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The approach of this order is absolutely direct,
                  uncomplicated, unpretentious, humble and extremely loving.
                </p>
                <p>
                  `Shattari’ linguistically means rapid or lightning quick. And
                  true to its name shattari mode is the quickest. On entering
                  shattari path the master (Pir) lifts the disciple (Mureed)
                  from the base Maaqam (station) of Shariyat and promotes him to
                  Tariqat in one go. Then depending upon capacity of each
                  disciple, he is carefully guided and made to progress through
                  advanced stages of Haqiqat and Maarifat.

                    Shattaris hold the key to secret meaning and mysteries of
                    `Koran’ and posses the veiled knowledge of
                    `Hurf-e-Muqattiyat’ (The secret alphabets). It is prohibited
                    to disclose this knowledge publicly as this is
                    `Baar-e-Amaanat’ (a trusted confidential deposit) of
                    Sher-e-Khuda Maula Mushkil kusha Ali Karam Allah wajho and
                    Hazrat Mohammed Rasool Allah. Any breach of trust and misuse
                    of this knowledge is a greatest of all sins. (

                    Shattari order (silsila) was introduced in India by Hazrat Abdullah Shattar Mast (d. 1472). He was great grandson (fifth generation) of Hazrat Shahbuddin Suharwardiya (Founder of Suharwardiya Khaanwad) and seventh lineage disciple to Hazrat Bayazid Bustami. He was honored with Khilafat (Spiritual Deputyhood) from all of the 14 Sufi orders (Khanwaads or Gharaanaas).
                    <div class="read-more-content"> Hazrat Abdullah Shattar Mast came from Iran and laid down the foundation and Doctrine of Shattari order in India and this order has flourished since then. After arriving in northern Bihar - India, he stayed in small towns like Daryapur, Manikpur, Jaunpur and Mandwa. He used to judge disciples even with their eating habits and would extend his teachings only to those who did proper justice to the food. Dressed in royal robes he used to travel on streets beating drums and openly invite people to witness GOD in his presence. His knowledge and authority in Spiritual matters was of highest degree.
                      Shrine of this great Sufi master is located in Kila Mandav, zilha Dhar, Madhya Pradesh. India

                      <p>Royals like Babur, Humayun, and Akbar held him in very high esteem. He was a pioneer in adapting ancient Indian yogic practices and meditative techniques in folds of Sufism and was instrumental in promoting secular values in lives of royals and commoners around him. He authored many books such as Jawahar-e-Khamsa, Bahrul Hayat, Aurad-e-Ghosia, Risala-e-Mehraajiya, Jamaya, Kabid Makhajan, Kanjul Vahida, etc. His other scholarly works includes a hand written `Koran’ (translated in Persian language) which is over 400 years old and has passed down through generations and now present in safe custody of my master – Sufi Mohammed Saeed Ali Shah.</p>

                        He earned extra-ordinary Spiritual and super natural powers spending 13 years in solitude of forest (jungle of chinaar) surviving with eating leaves from tress and devoted all his life in quest of the ultimate truth, in deep meditation and continues remembrance of GOD.

                        The spiritual formulas (Naqsh / Taaveez) innovated by him are still source of relief and blessings (Faiz) to one and all. Aasmaa-e-gousia is one such recitation (wird) which is has provided relief to all those who use it in times of difficulties. It has been experienced that recitation of this name `Yaa Mohammed Ghouse Gwaliori’ itself is cure to all kinds of physical, mental and spiritual diseases.

                        His famous claim of experiencing the mystical journey `mehraaj’ thrice brought him trouble from extremist Islamic fronts to which he remained immune. Angered with this, Prominent and learned mufti of that time Hazrat Shah Wajihuudin Gujrati  (Ahmedabad) came to issue fatwah against this claim but after witnessing his spiritual station (maqaam), surrendered and become a worthy disciple of Mohammed Ghouse gwaliori. Legendary famous singer Hazrat Tansen was orphaned at young age. He grew up under care and spiritual influence of Hazrat Mohammed Gouse and became greatest singer of all time.  He was also one of the Khalifa (spiritual deputy) of Hazrat Mohammed Ghouse.

                    Hazrat Sufi Gafoor Shah Qadri Shattari also known as Gaffar Baig is another shining star in the shattari skies. His family derives noble connection from Hazrat Sayyed Hashim youngest son of Hazrat Abdul Kader Zilani – Baghdad. <br>
Born in a rich Muslim family in a place called Muradabad latter moved to Pune along with his family. He was inclined towards religion from a very young age. He had burning desire for knowledge and in this quest he himself became a scholar in Islamic studies. He had great command on Urdu and Persian Language. He was a brilliant professor in Government training collage in pune. Latter he became an Imam in a mosque at daroowala pool – Pune. Although grounded in Islamic orthodoxy, he still felt that he was away from the ultimate truth and longed for a master who would lead him to salvation. <br>
During this time he happened to meet a fakir near his mosque who openly offered people the right and direct path to meet GOD and denounced the narrow minded approach to Islam. This Fakir who instantly caught attention of Hazrat Gafoor Shah was Hazrat Abdullah Shah Hussaini (Disciple of Hazrat Sufi Sarmast Ali Shah). <br>
In this manner he was introduced to Shattari Lineage. His heart melted with the teachings of Hazrat Abdullah Shah Hussaini but being an Islamic Scholar for so many years his mind was not fully convinced and he demanded quranic explanation for all beautiful revelation of the Shattari path.
On this he was directed to go to Nandura and visit Hazrat Sufi Sarmast Ali Shah. When he reached there very soon he realized that he has reached the truth itself and under guidance of Hazrat Sufi Sarmast Ali Shah Qalender became enlightened almost instantly. He gave up his worldly life, riches and family. He did get married due to family pressure but did not consummate the marriage. He relieved his wife on the next day lawfully with respect and apologies and continued on his mission to serve Shattari lineage. There are volumes of literature and poems (more than 5000 nos.) authored by him which are source of wisdom for generation to come. His pen names were `Safeer’ and `Sufi Sarmast’. Few of his famous works are a) Savaane hayaat Mehboob-e-Subhani. b) Karbala ke baad. c) Hurf-e-Muqatteaat. d) Sirre Haqiqat. <br>
Great political leaders of that time like Lokmanya Tilak and Mahatma Jyotiba Phule considered him as guru and use to come to him for guidance. Mahatma Jyotiba Phule has written a book (in local language – Marathi) in his honor called `Yancha Alp parichay’ meaning `his brief introduction’ and is still available in Pune Central library.

                    Hazrat  Sufi Hidayatulllah Shah Husaini  Kadri Shattari  (Nandura – Dist. Buldhana, Maharashtra) (d. 10th oct. 1993) (14th rabi-ul-Aakhir 1414) 
                  </h4>
                  <p>
                    Was originally known as Abdul Hafeez Shaikh. He was murid of Hazrat Gafoor Shah Kadri Shattari and honor of Khilafat was bestowed upon him by Hazrat Mohammed Shah Husaini. Born in a poor family and after losing his mother in early childhood he was forced to an orphanage along with his younger sister Bibi Fatima and brother Suja Ahmed. But Sufi Mohammed Shah who was a distant relative to them did not approve of this and took these children under his own safe custody. He grew up under Sufi influence of Hazrat Mohammed Shah Husaini from whom he learned all core aspect of Sufism and developed extra-ordinary authority on `tassawuf’ and `Irfan’. Although he had very little formal education he developed excellent command in URDU language with his own initiative. After receiving Khilafat he gave up his job as a driver and dedicated all his life to the service of Shattari Silisila.

                  <p class="read-more-content">
                    Simplicity, humbleness, innocence, and politeness all these words are ineffective and inadequate to describe the pure `Khaksari’ of this saint.  His love and sincerity towards Shattari Silisila earned him his resting place next to Hazrat Sufi Sarmast Alisha Qalander in Sufi Baug (Nandura) <br>
                    He passed on Khilafat and bestowed Sajjada Nashini to his beloved disciple Sufi Mohammed Saeed Ali Shah son of Hazrat Mohammed Shah Hussaini.

                    Hazrat Sufi Mohammed Saeed Ali Shah
                  </h4>
                  <p>
                    He is also known with the title `Sufi Saheb’ by many of his followers. Born on 5th May 1942 as 4th child in the family of 6 children in `Bhendi Bazaar’ locality of Bombay. He is the worthy son of Hazrat Mohammed Shah Husaini Kadri Shattari. (A renowned Shattari Saint – discussed in above passages). He graduated in science (B. Sc) from Jai Hind collage in 1965 with distinction. 
                  </p>
                  <p class="read-more-content">
                    He has been extremely hard working since childhood and was never ashamed of doing any kind job to help his mother, Aminabi, who used to make `bidis’ at home to afford a living and education to her children. His hardwork and honesty rewarded him with extremely successful career. He got married to Bibi Rabia in 1969. Being an ideal life partner, Sufi Rabia bi has been a source of support and motivation to Sufi Saheb. Sufi Saheb managed to give luxurious life to his entire family. But being from the royal blood, success never affected his pure self and he remained a Sufi Faqir from within. He became murid of Hazrat Sufi Hiyadullah Shah Husiani in 1969 at Gwalior inside the dargah of Hazrat Mohammed Ghouse Gwaliori. He was blessed with Khilafat in the year 1975 and was crowned as Sajjada nashin in 1981. As he reached to higher managerial level in his career the corruption, dishonesty, greed and foul politics around him started to suffocate him as all this was contradictory to his Sufi teachings and above all his own pure self. He resigned from the job and devoted all his energies towards the welfare of Shattari Silsila. <br>
                    He has always been a torch bearer of Shattari lineage ever since the responsibility of Khilafat and Sajjadagi was bestowed upon him by Hazrat Sufi Hidayatullah Kadri Shattari who loved him more than his own children. For more than 40 years he has given selfless service and has completely offered his being to the cause of Shattari Silsila. His contribution to this Silsila  has been all round including financial, spiritual, ethical and social support. Sufi Gafoor Shah Dargah trust was formed by him in 1988 and introduced Sufi Shattari Jamaat in the year 2003.
                    His love for his murshid is beyond imagination of common man and his eyes still gets moist when someone mentions his murshids name. <br>
                    He remains a power house of Spiritual wisdom and his understanding of Sufi Mysticism makes him one of the greatest saints of present times. Yet the child like innocence in his eyes sweeps you of your feet.
